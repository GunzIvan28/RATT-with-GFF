###### INSTALL DEPENDENCIES ######

1. Follow the links provided in the RATT-with-GFF README.md under PREREQUISITES
    to install the programs that RATTwithGFF.py is dependent upon
    
    a. you will need to install:
        *EMBLmyGFF3
        *Rapid Annotation Transfer Tool (RATT)
        *The European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite (EMBOSS)
        *Quality Assesment Tools for Genome Assemblies (QUAST)

    b. once installed, make sure each of these programs can be called from anywhere
        without having to give the direct path. If you cannot, add the direct path to
        each script to your PATH vaiable in .bashrc in your home directory and open a 
        new terminal

2. Clone the RATT-with-GFF repository to your computer

3. Change directory to RATT-with-GFF/example/
    a. within this directory, a Cryptosporidium Parvum chromosome sequence (.fa) and
        annoutation (.gff) are provided.

4. make sure you can call each dependency from this directory
    a. try inputing EMBLmyGFF3.py, start.ratt.sh, seqret, and quast.py into your terminal
        if the script is not found, add the direct path to each script to your .bashrc file
        in your home directory and open a new terminal


###### Running RATTwithGFF.py with Examples######

1. While in the directory with the example sequence and annotation, execute RATTwithGFF.py with
    the following command:
    
    ../RATTwithGFF.py CM000429.1.gff CM000429.1.fa CM000429.1.fa example Assembly

    This will run the script and attempt to transfer the annotations back to the same sequence.
    If everything is running correctly, nearly all of the features should be transferred

2. when the run is complete (~5 min), you can check the transfer statistics by changing directories
    to example_RATT/ and calling the command:
    
    head -20 transferStats.csv

    This will tell you the number of features in the starting and ending annotation files as well
    as some information regarding the quality of the assemblies. 

    The newly generated annotation files will be located in example_RATT/final_gff


####### Running RATTwithGFF.py with your Assemblies and Annotations ###########

1. Make a directory that contains your reference genome sequence, your reference annotation file
    and the genome sequence that you wish to transfer the annotations to.
2. Execute the RATTwithGFF.py script using this command:

    /<path_to_script>/RATTwithGFF.py <reference_annotation.gff> <reference_sequence.fasta> <query_sequence.fasta> <run ID> <Transfer Type>

    The run ID can be any string that you wish to use as an identifier for the following run.
    The script will use this ID to name the RATT output directory

    The transfer type will tell the RATT program what parameters you wish to use. This usually
    depends on how the reference and query organisms are related.
    
    Valid transfer types: Assembly, Assembly.Repetative, Strain, Strain.Repetative, Species,
        Species.Repetative, Multiple


###### Examining Results ######

The transferred annotations can be found in the <runID>_RATT/final_gff directory. Each scaffold/contig will have its own gff
there will also be a combined gff called genomic.final.gff. These files can now be loaded into a genome browser like Artemis
for examination.
